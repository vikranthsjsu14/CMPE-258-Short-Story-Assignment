Title: Loss Functions in Deep Learning

Article Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04242

Abstract: Loss functions are at the heart of deep learning, shaping how models learn and perform across diverse tasks. They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. Also cover the history of loss functions and see the pregression over time. I discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.
